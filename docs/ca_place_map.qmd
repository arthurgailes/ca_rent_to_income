Project Description: A statewide map comparing the median home price in every jurisdiction to metropolitan household income. Generally, three to five is considered to be a healthy rate---this interactive map will reveal potentially exclusionary jurisdictions.

Note: the title says rents to income, but the description specifies home price, so I did both. Rents are compared to monthly income.
